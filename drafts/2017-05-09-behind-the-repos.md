Hello,

Please join me in congratulating Shobhit Agarwal who will be our first ever Google Summer of Code student! Shobhit will be spending the summer with us working on refreshing the Collect user experience. Many of you already know him from his significant contributions over the past few months.

Shobhit is from Kanpur, India and is currently a 4th year undergraduate student in Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad, India. He loves coding for fun and has been developing for Android for 3 years.

Thank you to all the amazing students who wrote great GSoC proposals and made important contributions over the past few months. You have all become important parts of the ODK community.
