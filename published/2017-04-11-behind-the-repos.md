Hi ODKers,

Let’s kick this issue off with a big welcome to Win ([@nribeka](https://github.com/nribeka)) who was just voted in by the project management committee as a committer to ODK!

Win has been part of the ODK community since 2012 when he worked on ODK Clinic’s integration with OpenMRS. He recently deepened his involvement by helping new ODK contributors on Slack (http://slack.opendatakit.org), reviewing pull requests, filing issues, and of course, writing code. ODK’s developer community is healthier because of Win’s efforts and we are glad to have him as a committer!

Speaking of healthy communities, if you aren’t on the [users’ list](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opendatakit) you should join and help answer support questions! It’s the fastest way to become a great contributor for these reasons:
1. Helping users gives you insight on how to make good design decisions on ODK and come up with features that matter.
2. Helping users reduces the time committers spend on support and that directly translates to more committer time fixing issues, reviewing code, and moving the project forward.
3. Helping users is fun and rewarding. Our users mostly work in social good and really appreciate our efforts. Sometimes they just need a little bit of help to succeed and you can make a big difference by providing that support!
